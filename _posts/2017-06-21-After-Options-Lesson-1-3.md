So.. i totally remembered to do all these posts. I'm gonna summarize these last few lessons quickly then. 

Lesson 1- spent editing blog with small amounts of deadpool

Lesson 2-  i spent the lesson making this quiz thing [https://repl.it/Ikib/5](https://repl.it/Ikib/5). Learnt a fair bit making it and was quite fun to make

Lesson 3- so far we made name commenters for the first 10 [https://repl.it/IvO4/1](https://repl.it/IvO4/1). Then I started writing this as they are inspecting our githubs so I needed this up. Will probably add another post for the rest of this lesson.
